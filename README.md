Verifying Datalog Optimizations in Rocq
=======================================

We will be formalizing the results in
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10390](Wang et al's paper). Specifically,
our goal is to create a mechanized proof of the FGH Rule, and
hopefully get to the magic sets example in the appendix.
